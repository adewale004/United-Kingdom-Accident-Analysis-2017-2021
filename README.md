# United Kingdom Accident Analysis 2017-2021

This project aims to analyze accident data in the United Kingdom from 2017 to 2021, preprocess the dataset, and generate key insights. The analysis provides valuable information on vehicle types, casualty severity, time trends, and more, helping to identify patterns and inform road safety initiatives.


## Technologies Used

- Power BI

## Data Source

The accident data was obtained from [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data).

## Data Analysis Process

1. Cleaned the dataset using Power Query, including removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and adjusting data types.
2. Visualized the top 5 vehicles involved in accidents using a bar chart.
3. Analyzed the distribution of drivers' sexes.
4. Examined casualty severity.
5. Explored casualties by road user.
6. Conducted time series analysis, including total accidents by year, total accidents by weekday, and total accidents by time of the day.

## Key Findings

- Cars were the most commonly involved vehicle type in accidents.
- The majority of accidents resulted in slight injuries, with a smaller percentage resulting in serious or fatal injuries.
- The majority of accidents occurred on weekdays, with Friday having the highest number of accidents.
- The most common time of the day for accidents was between 3pm to 6pm.
